# Running Instructions
Both Projects (Image Rotator REact and Koa Middleware) are merged as a single project directory. 

You will need to have NodeJS, npm(1 previous version), and Koajs in order to run the projects

# Project 1 (React Image Rotator)
I did not build production version, so you will need to run "npm start" in the root directory (image-rotator-react) which will open the browser tab for http://localhost:3000/ that looks like the screenshot.JPG. 

# Project 2 (Koajs Middleware)
Entry file lives in koaMiddleware directory, so after you cd into that directory and run "node koaApp.js", you will be able to see simple page showing geo location and weather.
